# PA6: HTTP Client

In this PA, you will write a HTTP client that will download a webpage given its URL (i.e., the link to the page). Just like the server in PA5, an HTTP server supports TCP connections. However, the difference is that HTTP servers use the standard HTTP protocol (built on top of TCP) and you must implement the client half of this protocol. As you can imagine, there are similar programs out there which perform similar functions. The most obvious example is your browser that can connect to a remote web server, download the content and view it in a nicely formatted manner inside the browser. Another example is the linux command wget, which downloads a given page; the difference between wget and a web browser is that wget just downloads the page while a web browser does many other things.  We are going to recreate the functionality of wget in this PA.  Rendering HTML is beyond the scope of this PA. 

See Canvas for details.
