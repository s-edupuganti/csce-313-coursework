# <p align="center">PA 0: Environment Setup, AddressSanitizer and GDB <br> Due on Tuesday 9/07/2021 at 11:59pm <p>

**Introduction**

The objective of this programming assignment is to help you prepare for other programming assignments by covering some introductory topics. During this assignment, you will be setting up your own development environment where you will work until the end of the semester, recap the basics of C/C++ programming and learn how to use AddressSanitizer and GDB to debug your programs. You are given a simple program, _buggy.cpp_ which implements a linked list data structure: There are several compile/syntax errors and several logical bugs which you are going to find using AddressSanitizer and GDB.

**Your Tasks**

1. Include any required header files in **_Blank A_**
2. Write the appropriate access specifier in **_Blank B_**
3. Change **Lines 15, 16, 21, 28, 29** (line numbers based on original file) to dereference before accessing a member value
4. Rewrite the code around **_Blank C_** so that it does not cause a segmentation fault
5. Add code in **_Blank D_** to free your nodes so you do not leak memory
