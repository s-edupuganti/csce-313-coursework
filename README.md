# pa2-implementing-a-linux-shell

In this programming assignment, you are going to implement your very own linux shell. Your shell should have the ability to function almost as much as the linux/ubuntu shell in your OS, which lets a user navigate through the file system and perform a wide variety of tasks using a series of easy to remember and simple commands. 

Please follow the instructions posted in Canvas about PA-2 to get started.
